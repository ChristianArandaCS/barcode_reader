This program is built to speed up and automate the return process for an ecommerce using Amazon,Ebay, Walmart, and Target.

The program requires images of the return label and an export of all returns that are being expected to arrive at a facility(warehouse) to be processed.
Once you have all the images in one folder you can copy and paste the path into the list directive (listdir)

Once you have the images you'll need to add the images to the path on which you cloned the ropository to

You can now run the script.
The script will return and excel titled "result.xlsw"
The excel is set up to copy all barcodes that are in a picture.
The image name will be on col "A" and the values associated to this image are going to be to the left of the image file name.
If there are more than one barcode present in a image they will all be noted down one cell apart.
